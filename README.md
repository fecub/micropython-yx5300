# micropython-yx5300
A general putpose library to control the YX5300 chip: http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/index.html

The MP3 module has a 4 pin connector. VC +, VC -, RX, TX. Power can be drawn from the ESP8266 ground and +5v pin. for serial communication cross the RX to TX between the two modules. 

This is a fork of https://github.com/umarsear/ESP8266-Connected-MP3-Player just to a create a learning opportunity for myself to take apart how serial communication works with micropython.
